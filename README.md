# vicdffhmap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

***vicdffhmap*** is a simple package containing sf objects for the
Victorian Department of Families, Fairness and Housingâ€™s divisions and
areas.

The Department of Families, Fairness and Housing has four divisions and
17 areas.

Areas are groups of local government areas.

Divisions are groups of areas.

We have used this simple aggregation approach to create sf objects by
summarising objects obtains using `strayr::read_absmap("lga2021")`

## Installation

You can install the development version of vicdffhmap from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zerogetsamgow/vicdffhmap")
```

## division_map

The following plot shows a map of the four divisionss which are
contained in `vicdffhmap::division_map`.

``` r
library(vicdffhmap)

## basic division_map
ggplot2::ggplot(
  division_map,
  ggplot2::aes(
    geometry = geometry,
    fill = division_name,
    label = division_name,
    x = cent_long,
    y = cent_lat
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(
   colour = vpstheme::bv.smoke
   )+
  ggplot2::geom_label(
    colour = vpstheme::bv.charcoal, 
    fill = "grey", size = ggplot2::unit(7,"pt"))+
  vpstheme::scale_fill_dffh(palette = "core", reverse = TRUE, guide = "none")+
  ggthemes::theme_map()+
  ggplot2::theme(
    legend.position.inside = c(.7,.7)
  )
```

## area_map

The following plot shows a map of the 17 areas which are contained in
`vicdffhmap::area_map`

``` r
## basic area_map
ggplot2::ggplot(
  area_map,
  ggplot2::aes(
    geometry = geometry,
    fill = area_name,
    label = area_name,
    x = cent_long,
    y = cent_lat
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(
   colour = vpstheme::bv.smoke
   )+
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(
    colour = vpstheme::bv.charcoal, 
    fill = vpstheme::bv.smoke, size = ggplot2::unit(3,"pt"),
    max.overlaps = 20,
    segment.colour = vpstheme::bv.smoke)+
  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(north_colours, west_colours, east_colours, south_colours), guide = "none")+
  ggthemes::theme_map()+
  ggplot2::theme(
    legend.position.inside = c(.7,.7)
  )
```

## area_tbl

The package contains a third dataset `vicedumap::area_tbl` which shows
the mapping of local government areas, to areas, to divisions

``` r
## print full table of regions, areas and lgas
knitr::kable(
  area_tbl
)
```
